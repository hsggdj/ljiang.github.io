##### Abstract

Three-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories with eight supercharges possess a unique duality known as 3d mirror symmetry. Under this correspondence, the Coulomb branch of one theory is equivalent to the Higgs branch of its mirror dual, and vice versa. Over the past decades, extensive effort has been devoted to charting the landscape of 3d mirror pairs, though progress has often been constrained by the need to identify suitable brane configurations. In this first instalment, we introduce a new quiver-based algorithm, termed Growth and Fusion, which completes a quartet of Higgsing algorithms alongside Decay and Fission, Quiver Subtraction, and Quiver Addition. Together, these four algorithms provide a systematic framework that circumvents the limitations of brane constructions, enabling us to determine the mirror dual of a given quiver and to systematically bootstrap new 3d mirror pairs. We demonstrate the power of this approach on a new class of circular 3d mirror pairs.
